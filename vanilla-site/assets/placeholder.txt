Assets Directory

This directory is for storing images, icons, and other media files used by the website.

To add your own assets:
1. Place your image files here (e.g., avatar.png, logo.svg, hero-image.jpg)
2. Update the src attributes in index.html to point to your files
3. Make sure to include descriptive alt text for accessibility

Recommended image formats:
- PNG for images with transparency or simple graphics
- JPG/JPEG for photographs
- SVG for logos and icons (scalable vector graphics)
- WebP for modern browsers (with fallbacks)

Example:
- If you add avatar.png, update index.html: <img src="assets/avatar.png" alt="Your description">
- For Open Graph images, add og-image.png and reference it in the meta tags
