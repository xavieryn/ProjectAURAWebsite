                The electrical system originally began with three voltages: 24V,
                12V, and 5V. We later simplified the design after realizing the
                12V rail was unnecessary because we were no longer using the 12V
                lidar. All high-power components could run directly from the 24V
                battery, and the low-power devices did not require a dedicated
                5V supply. Instead, we used a high-wattage power bank, which
                provided an integrated BMS and safely powered the Raspberry Pi,
                USB camera, and UWB modules. This reduced complexity and
                increased system safety.

              <ul class="detail-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>24V system:</strong> Breakers were sized slightly
                  above the continuous current draw of each motor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>5V system:</strong> All 5V devices were powered
                  through the Raspberry Pi, which was connected to a
                  high-wattage power bank.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mounting:</strong> 3D printed C-clamps secured the
                  electrical system to the underside of the cart.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Power distribution:</strong> Wago connectors were used
                  on power lines to make it easy to isolate and test individual
                  components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data lines:</strong> Soldered connections were used
                  because communication signals are more sensitive and require
                  reliable joints.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prototyping:</strong> We transitioned from solderless
                  breadboards to soldered boards to improve robustness during
                  testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cable management:</strong> Velcro zip ties were used
                  to organize and bundle wiring.
