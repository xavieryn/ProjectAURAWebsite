              Our design process felt like a sprint up a steep hill. We knew from the start that even our MVP was pushing it, so the only way to make progress was to move quickly, test ideas often, and follow whatever paths created the least friction. We got each subsystem working on its own first, almost like scattered puzzle pieces, and then slowly brought them together into a single system. There were plenty of moments when we disagreed about the final design and couldn't settle on one direction, but each time we returned to the MVP to figure out what was truly necessary. If something didn't help us reach that minimal goal, we let it go.

              Money pushed us to be creative too. Even after adding some of our own funds, we still couldn't afford certain parts like a lidar. We borrowed one, struggled with its integration with our cart, and was eventually lucky enough to borrow a depth camera from another team that better suited our needs.

                <h3>Why Depth Camera?</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                We chose a depth camera over a 360-degree lidar because we couldn't find a good way to mount the lidar where it could actually see everything around the cart. The best we could do was place it in the front, which would have limited it to about 180 degrees of coverage. On top of that, the lidar we had access to was older and much harder to work with. It needed PoE and a more complicated setup, while the depth camera (a RealSense) connected cleanly over USB-C and already had a ROS2 integration we could use right away. The existing ROS2 publisher made it simple to get depth data streaming, so the depth camera ended up being the most practical choice for our system.
